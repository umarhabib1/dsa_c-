What is a Data Structure?

A data structure is a way of organizing, storing, and managing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.

👉 In simple words:
Data structure = how data is stored + how we access it

Why Do We Need Data Structures?

Without data structures:

Data would be messy 😵

Programs would be slow 🐌

Searching, inserting, or deleting data would be hard

With data structures, we can:

Store large amounts of data efficiently

Access data quickly

Use memory properly

Write optimized programs

Example (Very Simple)

If you want to store:

5, 10, 15, 20


You can store it using:

Array

Linked List

Stack

Queue

Each one stores and handles data differently.



Types of Data Structures
1. Primitive Data Structures

Basic data types provided by programming languages:

int

float

char

double

bool

Example in C++:

int a = 10;
char ch = 'A';

2. Non-Primitive Data Structures

More complex and user-defined.

(a) Linear Data Structures

Data is stored in a sequence:

Array

Linked List

Stack

Queue

Example:

10 → 20 → 30 → 40



(b) Non-Linear Data Structures

Data is stored in a hierarchical or graph form:

Tree

Graph

Example:

       10
      /  \
     5   15


Key Operations in Data Structures

Insertion

Deletion

Traversing

Searching

Sorting



Importance in Real Life

Google search results

Facebook friend lists

Navigation apps (maps)

Databases
